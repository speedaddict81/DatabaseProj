# DatabaseProj
Database Class Project (PHP/MySQL)
By Daniel O'Neill, Seth Daily, and Julio Cabral

This application was designed and tested using WAMP Server
Simply clone the repository into your wamp/www folder
Initialize the MySQL Database by importing sql.rtf into a database in PHPMyAdmin
Edit sql.php to reflect your database name and connection parameters


This application was not intended for actual use (little effort went into the login process)
